## Requirement
- Valheim version 0.156.2

- BepInEx 5.4.1500

## Setup
1. Make sure Valheim is not running.

3. Download latest release from https://github.com/jhekyll/vakyllheim/releases
4. Extract the downloaded zip folder
5. Copy the contents into `<Steam Location>\steamapps\common\Valheim\`
6. You can now open the game

## Keybinds
You are responsible to your keybindings found in config files, not me.

- Class skills: look for ValheimLegends.cfg. find "[Keybinds]" section w/o quotations.
- Emote wheel: look for virtuacode.valheim.emotewheel.cfg. find "[General]" section w/o quiotations.
- EquipWheel: look for virtuacode.valheim.equipwheel.cfg. find "[General]" section w/o quiotations.

## Graphics
Valheim FPS plus will lower your graphics to get more FPS when you open the game. But if you want to change it, I made some config files that you can use to replace the default config under BepInEx/config/

KillerGoldFisch.ValheimFPSPlus.cfg <-- config in use that you want to replace
